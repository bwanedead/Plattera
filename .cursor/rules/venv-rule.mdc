    If you are attempting to use the terminal for some task, remember that the venv likely needs to be activated in the terminal you use.  
  The venv is located in the project root, and the activation command is:

      .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

  Please never try to install dependencies without first asking for permission.  
  Additionally, always ensure the venv is activated before proceeding — this is extremely important.  

  Furthermore, it should be the standard to activate the venv before terminal usage of any type as a prophylactic measure.  
  The venv must be activated in order for dependencies to be available.
